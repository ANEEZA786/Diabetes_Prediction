# Diabetes_Prediction using PIMA Dataset
In this projet, diagnost the diabetes wheather a person is diabetic or not by using PIMA dataset. The dataset contains several independendent variables and one
dependent variable which is actually Outcome. Independent variable contains patient BMI, their insulin level, age and many other factors.

As this is the supervised classification problem because outcome is in categorical form i.e. the patient is diabetic (1) or not (0). 
Initially, applied RandomForest Classifier which is an ensembler technique. Later on, tried different classification models to check on which model it shows better
accurracy.
